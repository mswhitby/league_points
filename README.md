# League Points

Create a function that takes the number of `wins`, `draws`, and `losses` as inputs and returns the number of points a team has obtained so far.

- `wins` get 3 points
- `draws` get 1 point
- `losses` get 0 points  
<br/>

*Examples:*
```
league_points(3, 4, 2) ➞ 13

league_points(5, 0, 2) ➞ 15

league_points(0, 0, 1) ➞ 0
```
